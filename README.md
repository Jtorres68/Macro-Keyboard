# Macro-Keyboard

Libraries needed:
  - Keyboard
  - U8glib
  - Adafruit BusIO
  - Adafruit GFX
  - Adafruit SSD1306
  
To install the Keyboard, U8glib, and Adafruit BusIO library:
  - On the Arduino IDE, go to Tools > Manage Libraries or press Ctrl+Shift+I
  ![Manage Lib](https://github.com/Jtorres68/Macro-Keyboard/blob/master/pic/ManageLib.png)
  - From there, search for the 3 libraries and select Install
  ![Example install](https://github.com/Jtorres68/Macro-Keyboard/blob/master/pic/exampleLib.png)
  
To install Adafruit GFX and Adafruit SSD1306:
  - Attached are two zip libraries, download the 2 zip folders and then in the Arduino IDE, go to Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP Library and select the downloaded libraries to open

## Uploading to Arduino
  To upload to the Arduino, make sure the macroboard is plugged in
  - In the Arduino IDE, in Tools, make sure the Board states "Arduino Leonardo" and make sure to be on the correct port
    - To find Arduino Leonardo, go to Tools > Board > Arduino AVR Boards > Arduino Leonardo
    ![Board Selection](https://github.com/Jtorres68/Macro-Keyboard/blob/master/pic/Board.png)
  - Select Verify (the chaeckmark on the top left corner) if any changes made and then select Upload (the right arrow next to the checkmark)
  
## Resetting an Arduino Pro Micro
  **If encountering an error during upload!!**
  - Open a blank sketch
  - Have a button connected to GND and RST
  ![Reset Button](https://github.com/Jtorres68/Macro-Keyboard/blob/master/pic/Rest.png)
  - Press Upload and as soon as you see the sketch uploading, press the button to ground the reset pin. This should reset the pro micro and you should be able to upload again
  
## Button Functionality
  - To explain the basics:
  ```
     Keyboard.press()           //presses and holds the key written inside
     Keyboard.print()           //sends or "prints" a string or a character to the computer 
     Keyboard.println()         //sends a string or character to the computer, followed by a newline and return
     Keyboard.release()         //releases the specified key
     Keyboard.releaseAll()      //releases all keys held  
     delay()                    //pauses the program for the amount of time in ms specified
   ```
